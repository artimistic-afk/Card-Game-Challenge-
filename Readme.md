# Card Game - Python Implementation

This project is a simple two-player card game simulation implemented in Python. The game uses a custom deck of cards with numbers from 1 to 10 (each repeated four times) and applies the Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm to shuffle the deck.

## Features
- Deck generation with numbers 1 to 10 (4 copies each)
- Fisher-Yates shuffle for randomizing the deck
- Two players with separate draw and discard piles
- Gameplay includes drawing cards, comparing them, and handling ties
- Automatic shuffling of discard piles back into draw piles when empty
- Declares a winner when one player runs out of cards

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the game by executing:
   ```bash
   python card_game.py
